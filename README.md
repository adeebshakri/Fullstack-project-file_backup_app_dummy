This my full stack stack project which is a dummy application for backing up files.
It is using microservices. The backend is built using Golang and Django. The front end is built using Reactjs. JWT token method is also incorporated.
This application helps a user to log into his account and view all the files on his different devices he has backed up. 
It also has a functionality to soft delete a file into a recycle bin from where the files can be restored bac or permanently deleted.
Tha application also shows the Report of different files with its different versions along with a Data Visualization of the Report.
